<h3><strong>1891 to 1930</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1891</strong> On May 12th, 1891, at age 19, Wilhelm Kahl, Frida's father, a Jew of Hungarian-German origin, sails from Germany to Mexico aboard the freighter "Borussia". He changes his German name "Wilhelm Kahl" to a more Spanish sounding name, "Guillermo Kahlo" and trades his Jewish religion for atheism.</p>
<p><strong>1898</strong> Guillermo Kahlo marries Frida's mother, Matilde Calderon y Gonzales, a native born Mexican of Spanish/Indian descent.</p>
<p><strong>1907</strong> On a rainy morning, July 6th, at 8:30 am, Magdalena Carmen Frieda Calderon is born in the "Blue House" in Coyoacán, Mexico. She is the 3rd of four daughters born to the couple: Matilde (1898-1951), Adriana (1902-1968), Frida (1907-1954) and Cristina (1908-1964).</p>
<p><strong>1913</strong> At age 6, Frida is struck with polio affecting the use of her right leg. Her leg grew very thin, and her foot was stunted in its growth. During her nine month convalescence, her father made sure that she regularly exercised the muscles in her leg and foot. Despite their efforts, her leg and foot remained deformed. Frida attempts to hide it by wearing pants, long skirts or two pairs of sock on her right foot.</p>
<p><strong>1922</strong> Frida commutes to Mexico City to begin classes at the National Preparatory School. Frida is one of only 35 girls to attend the prestigious school with hopes of becoming a doctor. At this point in her life she has no interest in pursuing a career as an artist.</p>
<p><strong>1923</strong> Frida and Alejandro become romantically involved.</p>
<p><strong>1924</strong> Frida begins helping her father in his photography studio. He teaches her how to use a camera and how to develop, retouch and color photographs. This experience will prove to be useful in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>1925</strong> Frida is hired as a paid apprentice to the commercial printmaker Fernando Fernandez, a close friend of her father's. Fernando teaches her how to draw and how to copy prints by the Swedish Impressionist Anders Zorn.</p>
<p><strong>1926</strong> While in recovery, Frida learns that she will never be able to have children. She creates a birth certificate for an imaginary son that she gave birth to after suffering her accident. She writes that her son, "Leonardo", was born in September of 1925 at the Red Cross Hospital [where Frida was treated after the accident]. She claims that he was baptized the following year and that his mother was Frida Kahlo and his Godparents were Isabel Campos and Alejandro Gómez Arias.</p>
<p><strong>1927</strong> In March, Alejandro departs for an extended tour of Europe. Frida and Alejandro communicate frequently by letter.</p>
<p><strong>1928</strong> Frida is introduced to a group of young people centered around the Cuban Communist Julio Antonio Mella, who is currently in exile in Mexico. One of the group members is the photographer Tina Modotti, Mella's lover and an acquaintance of Diego Rivera.</p>
<p><strong>1929</strong> On August 21, in a civil ceremony in the town hall of Coyoacán, Kahlo becomes Rivera's third wife. Diego was 42 years old, 6'1" tall, and 300 pounds; Frida was 22, 5'3" tall and only 98 pounds. Frida's mother does not approve of the union saying that Diego is too old and too fat and worse yet he is a Communist and an atheist. Frida's father is less resistant to the marriage. He understands that Diego has the financial means to provide for his daughter's medical needs. Frida's friends are shocked by her choice while others see it as a way for Frida to advance her own career as an artist.</p>
<p><strong>1930</strong> In the beginning of the year, Frida undergoes an abortion because the fetus is incorrectly positioned due to her fractured pelvis. [Diego did not want children partly because painting commissions obliged them to travel a great deal.]</p>

<h3><strong>1931 to 1943</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1931</strong> From November 1930 to June 1931, the Rivera's live in San Francisco while Diego works on a mural. During this period, the pain and deformity in Frida's right leg worsens and she is hospitalized. There she meets Dr. Leo Eloesser, a well-known bone surgeon. Dr. Eloesser has been a friend of Diego's since 1926. He becomes Frida's most trusted medical advisor for the rest of her life.</p>
<p><strong>1932</strong> In March, the Rivera's move to Philadelphia. In April the couple move to Detroit where Rivera has been awarded another commission from the Ford Motor Company to paint a mural at the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>
<p><strong>1933</strong> In March, the couple returns to New York where Rivera agrees to paint a mural in the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center.</p>
<p><strong>1934</strong> The Rockefeller Center mural is destroyed Feb. 10, 1934.</p>
<p><strong>1935</strong> Frida leaves the house in San Angel for several months and takes her own apartment in central Mexico City (Avenida Insurgentes 432). In July, she travels to New York with Anita Brenner and Mary Schapiro. By the end of the year she returns to the house in San Angel and she and Diego reconcile. They agree to live separate independent lives.</p>
<p><strong>1936</strong> Frida has a third operation on her right foot.</p>
<p><strong>1937</strong> On January 9th, Leon Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, arrive in Mexico, where he has been granted political asylum, largely through Rivera's intervention. Frida gives them the use of the Blue House in Coyoacán. Shortly after their arrival, Frida and Trotsky become close and engage in a secret relationship. The affair ends in July.</p>
<p><strong>1938</strong> In April, French poet and surrealist André Breton and his wife, the painter Jacqueline Lamba, visit Mexico in order to meet Trotsky. They stayed with Guadalupe Marin, Diego Rivera's previous wife, and meet the Kahlo-Riveras. When Breton sees Kahlo's unfinished "What the Water Gave Me", the metaphorical self-portrait of what life had given her - floating on the water of her bathtub - he immediately labels her an innate "surrealist", and offers to show her work in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>1939</strong> Kahlo travels to Paris in January for "Mexique", an exhibition of her works in the Colle Gallery. It opens on March 10th and includes Kahlo's work as well as the works of photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo and Breton's own collection of Mexican popular art. One of the paintings shown was the self-portrait "The Frame" which was purchased by The Louvre. This painting became the first work by a 20th century Mexican artist to be purchased by the Louvre.</p>
<p><strong>1940</strong> In January "The Two Fridas" and the now lost "The Wounded Table" are exhibited in the "International Surrealism Exhibition" organized by Breton and Paalen at the Gallery of Mexican Art.</p>
<p><strong>1941</strong> In February, no longer under suspicion, Diego returns to Mexico, joined by his California assistant, Emmy Lou Packard. He lives in the Kahlo family home in Coyoacán with Frida, using the San Angel house as his studio.</p>
<p><strong>1942</strong> On February 28th, Frida participates in the "Seminario de Cultura Mexicana" (Seminar of Mexican Culture).</p>
<p><strong>1943</strong> In January, Frida is included in "Exhibition by 31 Women" at Peggy Guggenheim's "Art of This Century" Gallery in New York.</p>

<h3><strong>1944 to 1958</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1944</strong> Frida's physical decline becomes more acute over the next few years. She undergoes spinal taps, confinement in a series of corsets, and several radical operations on her back and leg over the next decade.</p>
<p><strong>1945</strong> After reading Freud's "Moses and Monotheism", Frida paints "Moses", her interpretation of Freud's book.</p>
<p><strong>1946</strong> In September, Frida is awarded the National Prize of Arts and Sciences, from the Ministry of Public Education for her painting "Moses".</p>
<p><strong>1947</strong> At the National Institute of Fine Arts in Mexico City, Frida's painting "Self-Portrait as a Tehuana" (Diego in My Thoughts) is exhibited in "Forty-Five Self-Portraits by Mexican Painters from the 18th to the 20th Centuries".</p>
<p><strong>1948</strong> At Rivera's request, Frida reapplies to join the Mexican Communist Party. Her membership is approved. (Rivera is not accepted back until 1954.)</p>
<p><strong>1949</strong> Cristina Kahlo, Frida's younger sister, confronts Maria Felix about her ongoing affair with Rivera and pleads with her to end the relationship for the sake of Frida. In June the Rivera/Felix affair abruptly ends.</p>
<p><strong>1950</strong> Kahlo is hospitalized for nine months because of recurring spinal problems. She undergoes a total of 7 operations on her spine during that period. Her hospitalization due in part to a severe infection in her bone grafts. She spends most of the year in the hospital, most nights Rivera sleeps in a room next to hers. When well enough she paints.</p>
<p><strong>1951</strong> Following her discharge from the hospital, she is confined to her bed for much of the time. Full-time nurses are hired to care for her and give her injections of pain killers.</p>
<p><strong>1952</strong> Frida helps to collect a list of signatures supporting the peace movement. Diego immortalizes her actions in his mural "The Nightmare of War and the Dream of Peace".</p>
<p><strong>1953</strong> Lola Alvarez Bravo organizes the first solo exhibition of Frida's works in Mexico. The exhibition runs from April 13th through the 27th at the Galería de Arte Contemporáneo. Frida's doctor tells her she is not well enough to attend the opening, but, in Frida style, she attends the opening. Her bed is loaded into the back of a truck and driven to the exhibition opening. Frida follows in an ambulance. Upon arrival, Frida returns to her bed and four men carry her inside to greet her friends.</p>
<p><strong>1954</strong> On April 19th, Frida is admitted to the hospital for reasons unknown. Some say it was a suicide attempt others say it was just failing health. In an April 27th diary entry she writes: "I am well again - I've made a promise and I'll keep it never to turn back". She continues with a three page "Thank You" note to the doctors, nurses and everyone who ever took care of her.</p>
<p><strong>1955</strong> Rivera is diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p><strong>1957</strong> On November 24, Diego Rivera dies of heart failure in his San Angel studio. He is buried in the "Rotunda of Famous Men" in Mexico City, in contradiction to his expressed wishes that he be cremated and his ashes commingled with those of Frida.</p>
<p><strong>1958</strong> On July 30th, the Casa Azul (Blue House) was opened to the public as the "Frida Kahlo Museum". The home was presented to the Mexican nation in accordance with the wishes of Diego Rivera.</p>
